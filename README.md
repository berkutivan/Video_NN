# Video_NN
This page is my attempt to study image processing using neural networks, namely, to learn how to predict the average frame in a video by two extremes.
Below is a description of the README:
[Structure of repository](#Structure)
# Structure:
1. [VNN.py](https://github.com/berkutivan/Video_NN/blob/main/VNN.py)- all functions of Unet
2. [main.py](https://github.com/berkutivan/Video_NN/blob/main/main.py) - code to generate the better quality video
3. [video_functions.py](https://github.com/berkutivan/Video_NN/blob/main/video_functions.py) - auxiliary code for video processing
4. [training_file.ipynb](https://github.com/berkutivan/Video_NN/blob/main/training_file.ipynb) - notebook with neural network training
